										<p class="about-company">
											It was 1984 when Jelexie Bakeshop was established in Tarlac City as a home-based bakeshop by its founder, Mr. Armando Tan who had just migrated from China to the Philippines. With its first branch in M.H. Del Pilar Street, Jelexie was mainly engaged in the distribution of breads in different canteens and supermarkets.
										</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-xl-12">
						<p class="about-company">
							After Mr. Tan passed away in 1990, his eldest son, Mr. Jimmy Tan, took over the company and began to enter Jelexie into the retail world. He opened two more branches within Tarlac province that same year and, wanting to live out his father's mission to become strategically competitive and innovative, opened another branch in 2000 and has been opening other branches almost every year since then. Today, it stands proud with 40 branches all over Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, and Pangasinan.
